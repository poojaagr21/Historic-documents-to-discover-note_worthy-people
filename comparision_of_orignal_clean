 This script can be used to generate the the following updated information at any time:

Input :
original_csv( generated from java program) contains document name and person name
 ocr_csv ( generated from java program) contains document name and person name)

Output
ocr list: all the names appear in ocr list in sorted order

Consider A as ocr and B as original
now with two cleaned data list i.e. ocr , original , performed (orig intersection ocr) A ∩ B to find the common names present in both
performed  ( A-(A ∩ B) )set function to find the names only present in ocr list
performed  ( B-(A ∩ B) )set function to find the names only present in orig list






Results Numbers
